### **Data Flow Interactions (Arrow Labels)**

#### Between UI and Application Server:
1. **Profile Submission** (e.g., Upload Profile): UI sends profile data for processing.
2. **Search Query** (e.g., Search Profile): UI sends search criteria to the application server.
3. **Job Request Creation** (e.g., Create Job Request): UI sends job details for processing.

#### Between Application Server and Database Server:
4. **Profile Storage**: Saves or updates candidate profiles.
5. **Job Data Retrieval**: Fetches job details or updates job statuses.
6. **Vendor Details Retrieval**: Provides vendor performance metrics and compliance information.

#### Between Application Server and External Services:
7. **Payment Processing**: Sends payment details to the payment gateway.
8. **Document Parsing**: Sends uploaded resumes to parsing services for structured storage.
9. **Notification Dispatch**: Sends messages to candidates, recruiters, or vendors.

#### Between Application Server and UI:
10. **Profile Search Results**: Returns search results for recruiter queries.
11. **Job Posting Updates**: Confirms the creation or modification of job requests.
12. **Dashboard Updates**: Displays real-time updates on job status or vendor metrics.
